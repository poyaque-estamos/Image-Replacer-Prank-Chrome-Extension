# Randomly replace images Prank Chrome Extension
This browser extension randomly and quietly replaces a percentage of pictures in each page with a picture of your choice.
The icon is a greyed out area so as to look like part of the browser, since Chrome doesn't allow for extensions to not have an icon anymore, meh.



# How to put in place aka, install it. 

1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Enable developer mode
3. Check out or download the repository somewhere in your 'friend's' computer
4. Use 'Read uncompressed extension'
5. Select the folder where you cloned/extracted the plugin. 

For better stealth, set the icon to invisible by right-clicking on it and selecting 'Hide in Chrome menu'


# Config
